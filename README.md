A chatbot using if-else statements involves creating a program that engages in conversations with users by using conditional statements to analyze and respond to their inputs.
The chatbot typically follows these steps:
User Input: Receives input from the user.
Processing: Uses if-else statements to check the input against predefined conditions.
Response: Generates a response based on the conditions met.
For instance, if a user asks a question, the chatbot might use if-else statements to identify keywords or patterns in the input to determine an appropriate response. If a specific keyword is found, the bot might deliver a predefined answer associated with that keyword. Otherwise, it might default to a general response or ask for clarification.

This method allows the chatbot to simulate conversation by recognizing certain triggers or conditions in the user's messages and responding accordingly, based on the programmed logic defined by if-else statements.
